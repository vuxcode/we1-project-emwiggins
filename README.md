Project Summary
Describe how you want to present the website to the world:
Emelie has made a little website that shows you a few pictures of a few products and a form that you can fill out if you have any other questions.

Emelie feels proud of what she has achieved in making her first ever website and satisfied that she can use the skills she has learned to solve the different design problems in making a website.

Describe what your experience of creating the website was like:
It was really difficult at first but then towards the end it was easier to create. Emelie was able to focus on creating the website and used both the lesson notes and her own notes to solve the problems by herself. She had more contact with the course leader and asked for more help when she needed it - which made a big difference. She was also able to talk through the problems and the way that she was thinking about everything!

"It was more fun at the end when the structure was in place." So Emelie felt like she could add and change things. Emelie gained confidence in her own skills to be able to solve the problems and she researched solutions by herself.

List what could be improved on the website if you had more time:
Emelie is interested in adding more styles to the scrollbar (needs more time to research this).
Did you manage to stick to the budget? Why? / Why not?
It probably more than 30 hours but it was difficult to find the starting point and spent too much time thinking about things. It is easier to start working when there is a clear vision and when you break things down into much smaller steps.
